# Belly-Button-Biodiversity


### Overview of the project

In this project we are helping Roza show cast her findings using charts that will display the bacteria cultures found on the volunteers’ navels. To accomplish this task we are creating three different charts:

- Bar Chart
- Bubble Chart
- Gauge Chart



#### Bar Chart

This chart displays the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage.


#### Bubble Chart

This chart displays the bacteria culture when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage.


#### Gauge Chart

This chart displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and displays the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
